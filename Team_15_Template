1.	Project Objective

Create an efficient and user-friend inventory management system for a local bookstore.

2.	Project Description

By pulling some inspiration from the Barnes and Noble inventory system, our team will create software named Book-Tora that will come equipped with uniquely organized databases to store and track all of the current products a store holds along with customer/publisher information and sales records. 
Book-Tora will also come with a simple user-friendly interface that will allow employees to search, log and update important information about the books a store holds in their inventory, their customers/publisher's information, and sales history.

3.	Project Scope


4.	Use Case and User Stories (Create at least 3 User Stories or Use Cases)

A bookstore employee should be able to log information about a book into their inventory system (such as title, author, ISBN, publisher, genre, price, etc.) under a menu item on the home screen (Book —> Adopt Book Info), so that the particular book can be searched easily for inventory management.

A bookstore employee should be able to search and filter the sales histories of specific book categories (title, genre, year released, author, etc.), so they can get sales information for that particular category.

A bookstore employee should be able to log information from a customer (such as name, date of birth, phone number, and email address) under a menu item on the home screen (Customers —> Adopt Customer Info), so that they can keep a record of past purchases and send out appropriate promotions when necessary.

A bookstore employee should be able to log information about publishers they use to purchase books from (such as name, address, contact, return policy, account number, etc.) under a menu item on the home screen (Publishers —> Adopt Publisher Info), so that when they search up that particular publisher all information needed is located on one page.

These meetings allow our team to be fully transparent of our progress and allows us to adapt to changes that may arise. 
Each member has a say in what they are able to do and feel open to share their opinion if a different direction is needed.
Suitable for the constant change in our project and lack of budget constraint
