1.	Project Objective

Create an inventory management system built for employees of a small local bookstore that will come equipped with a user-friendly UI, and backing logic.

2.	Project Description

By pulling some inspiration from the Barnes and Noble inventory system, our team will create Book-Tora software. It will involve making a React based user interface designed with easily accessible menus that will allow bookstore employees to store, search, and link important inventory, customer, and publisher information. 
Our team will create an SQL backend to store all inputted data in an organized fashion.

3.	Project Scope


4.	Use Case and User Stories (Create at least 3 User Stories or Use Cases)

A bookstore employee should be able to log information about a book into their inventory system (such as title, author, ISBN, publisher, genre, price, etc.) under a menu item on the home screen (Book —> Adopt Book Info), so that the particular book can be searched easily for inventory management.

A bookstore employee should be able to search and filter the sales histories of specific book categories (title, genre, year released, author, etc.), so they can get sales information for that particular category.

A bookstore employee should be able to log information from a customer (such as name, date of birth, phone number, and email address) under a menu item on the home screen (Customers —> Adopt Customer Info), so that they can keep a record of past purchases and send out appropriate promotions when necessary.

A bookstore employee should be able to log information about publishers they use to purchase books from (such as name, address, contact, return policy, account number, etc.) under a menu item on the home screen (Publishers —> Adopt Publisher Info), so that when they search up that particular publisher all information needed is located on one page.

6.	Project Management Plan and Methodologies

Agile
Project management philosophy that acheives goals in smaller increments and time frames.
Allows to adopt to changing features and potential issues
Reduces time applied on projects and increases efficiency

Scrum
Implements Agile project management philosophy
Consitent meetings every week instead of everyday to create a weekly sprint of our duties. 
These meetings allow our team to be fully transparent of our progress and allows us to adapt to changes that may arise. 
Each member has a say in what they are able to do and feel open to share their opinion if a different direction is needed.
Suitable for the constant change in our project and lack of budget constraint
