Agile
Project management philosophy that acheives goals in smaller increments and time frames.

Reduces time applied on projects and increases efficiency

Scrum
Implements Agile project management philosophy
Consitent meetings every week instead of everyday to create a weekly sprint of our duties. 
These meetings allow our team to be fully transparent of our progress and allows us to adapt to changes that may arise. 
Each member has a say in what they are able to do and feel open to share their opinion if a different direction is needed.
Suitable for the constant change in our project and lack of budget constraint
