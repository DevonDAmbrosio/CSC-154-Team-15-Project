1.	Introduction
1.1.	Project Objectives 

Create an inventory management system built for employees of a small local bookstore that will come equipped with a user-friendly UI, backing logic, and databases

1.2.	Project Scope

Book-Tora will be able to have twenty employees and four super users logged in at one time and be able to maintain a maximum of 5,000 records. Each user will be able to login and access the database via Book-Toraâ€™s website user interface with a client/server architecture using PHP and SQL. The super users will have the additional privilege of having the ability to enter and delete entries within the database using the user interface. The database will be stored on a local server internal to the business and will not need the use of an internet connection for access.

1.3.	Project Overview 



2.	General Description

By pulling some inspiration from the Barnes and Noble inventory system, our team will create Book-Tora software. It will involve making a React based user interface designed with easily accessible menus that will allow bookstore employees to store, search, and link important inventory, customer, and publisher information. Our team will create an SQL backend to store all inputted data in an organized fashion.
